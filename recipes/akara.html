<h2>Description</h2>
<p> <em>Akara</em>, which is also known as black-eyed peas fritters, beans fritters, or Acaraje, is a very delicious, deep-fried bean cake made from black-eyed peas paste.</p>

   <p> These are quick, easy, and tasty and involves only a handful of simple ingredients â€“ black-eyed peas, peppers, onions, salt, and seasoning cube. It is a vegetarian-friendly meal eaten in most parts of West Africa and Brazil. </p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Soak for about 30 minutes or till the skin swells.</li>
    <li>Peel off the beans with your hands (the hard way) or use a blender and pulse a couple of times to split the beans (the easy way)</li>
    <li>Blend the peeled beans with peppers, crayfish, salt, and bouillon powder.</li>
    <li>Whisk until the batter becomes airy and fluffy. This will take about a minute to 5 minutes depending on the tool you use. Electric hand whisk takes about a minute to two, regular hand whisk will take about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in the diced onions.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oil and scoop the mixture by spoonfuls into the pan</li>
    <li>Fry till golden brown!</li>
</ol>
